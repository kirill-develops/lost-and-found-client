# LOST & FOUND

### React.js app

*is an eco-system that leverages technology to build on the foundation of paying it forward!*

It's also my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp. We were tasked to ideate, plan, and execute a full-stack application within two weeks. Lost&Found was made using create-react-app, react-router, axios, react-burger-menu, react-select, swiper and SASS for the front end, a Node/Express backend API leveraging Passport.js & the passport-google-Oauth2 strategy for authentication, and Knex to migrate, seed and query a MySQL database. At least for now. We'll see how things change as I continue to build on it.

You can visit a live Demo [here](https://lostnfound.netlify.app/)

Below are instructions on how to install the React.js front-end app. If you
haven't already, please install the back-end Node/Express API server first.
